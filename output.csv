1,Good assessment of our goal  
2,@ScottAdamsSays If not perhaps 30
3,@FoundersPodcast Yup
4,deamplify means shadowban
5,The higher the rates, the harder the fall
6,@ggreenwald This is extremely concerning
7,@jxeral Ironically, the company that made the first commercially viable internal combustion engine car saved the company that made the first commercially viable electric car!
8,@jxeral True, the Daimler investment in 2009 is actually what saved Tesla
9,@HistoryBoomer That’s what she said
10,I wonder what would have happened in 2009 if the Fed had raised rates instead of lowering them 🤔  
11,@ScottAdamsSays Easier to argue that global warming is a risk (rather than a certainty), but it is foolish to roll those dice, given that we will eventually run out of fossil fuels and have to generate energy sustainably anyway.
12,@skorusARK There will probably be far more robots than humans in the future
13,@WaltDisneyWorld This looks cool!
14,@ggreenwald Please post what you received on Twitter
15,Twitter will publish tweet recommendation code &amp; make account/tweet status visible no later than next month.  Transparency builds trust.

21,Bookmark button moving to tweet details page, fixing image length crop &amp; other minor bug fixes next week
22,@MichaelPSenger @DrJBhattacharya Precisely
23,@SpaceX @Space_Station Much higher dynamic range camera needed to see the stars!
24,@JohnnaCrider1 Few realize this consciously
25,@neontaster Resistance is futile
26,@NASASpaceflight That’s a good guess
27,@MuskUniversity Exactly
28,@weirdterrifying Ancient Egypt was 🔥🔥
29,@johnkrausphotos @lexfridman @MrBeast Ok
30,@LuehWai @JamesMelville Maiden America?
31,@JamesMelville Sigh
32,Starship launch attempt soon  
33,@LucasFoxNews No kidding …
34,@Snowden Most people have no idea that Reality Winner is a real person. Fate 🖤 irony.
35,@TheRabbitHole84 @WallStreetSilv Maybe we should spend less time on social media … ?
36,@Tesmanian_com Starlink in aircraft feels the same as a high speed connection on the ground
37,@WallStreetSilv Demolition Man movie is becoming real
38,@ShellenbergerMD Constitutional violation
39,@WillManidis This a major problem. Adderall is just low-grade speed &amp; greatly amplifies your inner a**hole!
40,@DrJBhattacharya This problem is extremely prevalent in academia
41,@EvaFoxU Please be cautious about writing articles citing “unnamed sources”, as they are frequently false
42,@SawyerMerritt @Tesla Great work by Tesla Team!
43,@WOLF_Financial 🤣

45,@tyromper 💯
46,Some things that your party tells you are false and some things that the other party says are true
47,@slashdot This seems extortionately high. It also isn’t clear whether, all things considered, a second booster helps or hurts.
48,@stillgray Good question
49,@cb_doge Yes, I don’t like it either.
50,All four orbital launch pads fully loaded with rockets for the first time!

52,@TrungTPhan That is dedication
53,@BillyM2k We will strive to increase the joy of Twitter!
54,@ggreenwald Tragic
55,@paulg New UI coming this week allowing easy switch between recommended &amp; followed. Recommendations will get much better later this year.
56,@ggreenwald True
57,@MuskUniversity This is the foundation of my philosophy
58,@greg16676935420 Any minute now …
59,@RGVaerialphotos @indnstar @Thomaseo01 @JaxLR07 @CSI_Starbase @RLT_Spaceflight @DeffGeff @TekG33k @BingoBoca @MrPleasantRS @rocketjunkie94 Massey’s gun range is being turned into a rocket test facility. Perfect match.
60,@IMAO_ @neontaster Agreed
61,@neontaster We will also be adding simple formatting features like bold, underline &amp; font size later this quarter.   The goal is to allow people to publish long-form natively on Twitter, rather than forcing them to use another website.  Twitter will continue to recommend brevity in tweets.
62,@neontaster Yes, these will get the same Timeline screen space as other tweets, but you will be able to click for more
63,I hope that the people of Brazil are able to resolve matters peacefully
64,(Chart by James Stephenson)  
65,@TrungTPhan 🔥🤣
66,@micsolana Step up your game 🤣🤣
67,Easy swipe right/left to move between recommended vs followed tweets rolls out later this week.  First part of a much larger UI overhaul.  Bookmark button (de facto silent like) on Tweet details rolls out a week later.  Long form tweets early Feb.
68,@WholeMarsBlog We have a real shot at late February.  March launch attempt appears highly likely.
69,@DavidSacks It will go lower

79,@mayemusk @CBSNews @Twitter The fake emerald mine thing is so annoying (sigh). Like where exactly is this thing anyway!?
80,@WholeMarsBlog Looks like V11.3 will be ready for wide release in about 2 weeks. Many major improvements.
81,@TrungTPhan !
82,@MuskUniversity Happy days tbh
83,@paulg True
84,Thread on how safe Tesla cars are
85,@paulg People on Twitter should like more tweets in general!
86,@BillyM2k @KevinChunilal Nice
87,@WholeMarsBlog @ValerianIlies People still don’t get it
88,@_TheRealTony3_ @MercedesBenz @Tesla @SawyerMerritt Good for them
89,@RichardGarriott Tanks are a deathtrap now. With neither side having air superiority, you’re left with infantry &amp; artillery – essentially WW1.

103,@Hitch_Slapping @DrJBhattacharya True
104,Ouch my feet!!
105,@cb_doge @MrAndyNgo @josephmenn @ExplainThisBob Will do. He is a good bot.
106,@MrAndyNgo @josephmenn Joseph Menn is a contemptible liar. Twitter policy has always been to suspend accounts that clearly &amp; repeatedly incite violence.
107,@jonastyle_ Journalists should do shots every time there is a negative article about me …
108,Elon Musk should
109,Subtle, but I am beginning to suspect opinions differ on this matter …  If not McCarthy, then seriously who?
110,@ChrisJBakke 🤣
111,Sped up trip there &amp; back again
112,@tomselliott 🤣🤣
113,@heliobeltrao @Rconstantino @rothbard_brasil If it is ordered by the court, do we have any choice?
