@ggreenwald Is it just one judge?
Good assessment of our goal  https://t.co/13GpEZlu0Z
@ScottAdamsSays If not perhaps 30
@FoundersPodcast Yup
deamplify means shadowban
"The higher the rates, the harder the fall"
@ggreenwald This is extremely concerning
"@jxeral Ironically, the company that made the first commercially viable internal combustion engine car saved the company that made the first commercially viable electric car!"
"@jxeral True, the Daimler investment in 2009 is actually what saved Tesla"
@HistoryBoomer That’s what she said
I wonder what would have happened in 2009 if the Fed had raised rates instead of lowering them 🤔  https://t.co/uDGUqg4GKq
"@ScottAdamsSays Easier to argue that global warming is a risk (rather than a certainty), but it is foolish to roll those dice, given that we will eventually run out of fossil fuels and have to generate energy sustainably anyway."
@skorusARK There will probably be far more robots than humans in the future
@WaltDisneyWorld This looks cool!
@ggreenwald Please post what you received on Twitter
Twitter will publish tweet recommendation code &amp; make account/tweet status visible no later than next month.  Transparency builds trust.
@BillyM2k 💯
@MarceloPLima They will be
@nathan_garner_ Yes
virtue rises with the sun
@patrickbetdavid @joerogan @BretWeinstein Great clip!
"Bookmark button moving to tweet details page, fixing image length crop &amp; other minor bug fixes next week"
@MichaelPSenger @DrJBhattacharya Precisely
@SpaceX @Space_Station Much higher dynamic range camera needed to see the stars!
@JohnnaCrider1 Few realize this consciously
@neontaster Resistance is futile
@NASASpaceflight That’s a good guess
@MuskUniversity Exactly
@weirdterrifying Ancient Egypt was 🔥🔥
@johnkrausphotos @lexfridman @MrBeast Ok
@LuehWai @JamesMelville Maiden America?
@JamesMelville Sigh
Starship launch attempt soon  https://t.co/QBprVsAH7m
@LucasFoxNews No kidding …
@Snowden Most people have no idea that Reality Winner is a real person. Fate 🖤 irony.
@TheRabbitHole84 @WallStreetSilv Maybe we should spend less time on social media … ?
@Tesmanian_com Starlink in aircraft feels the same as a high speed connection on the ground
@WallStreetSilv Demolition Man movie is becoming real
@ShellenbergerMD Constitutional violation
@WillManidis This a major problem. Adderall is just low-grade speed &amp; greatly amplifies your inner a**hole!
@DrJBhattacharya This problem is extremely prevalent in academia
"@EvaFoxU Please be cautious about writing articles citing “unnamed sources”, as they are frequently false"
@SawyerMerritt @Tesla Great work by Tesla Team!
@WOLF_Financial 🤣
@BillyM2k 🎯
@tyromper 💯
Some things that your party tells you are false and some things that the other party says are true
"@slashdot This seems extortionately high. It also isn’t clear whether, all things considered, a second booster helps or hurts."
@stillgray Good question
"@cb_doge Yes, I don’t like it either."
All four orbital launch pads fully loaded with rockets for the first time!
@mtaibbi Exactly
@TrungTPhan That is dedication
@BillyM2k We will strive to increase the joy of Twitter!
@ggreenwald Tragic
@paulg New UI coming this week allowing easy switch between recommended &amp; followed. Recommendations will get much better later this year.
@ggreenwald True
@MuskUniversity This is the foundation of my philosophy
@greg16676935420 Any minute now …
@RGVaerialphotos @indnstar @Thomaseo01 @JaxLR07 @CSI_Starbase @RLT_Spaceflight @DeffGeff @TekG33k @BingoBoca @MrPleasantRS @rocketjunkie94 Massey’s gun range is being turned into a rocket test facility. Perfect match.
@IMAO_ @neontaster Agreed
"@neontaster We will also be adding simple formatting features like bold, underline &amp; font size later this quarter.   The goal is to allow people to publish long-form natively on Twitter, rather than forcing them to use another website.  Twitter will continue to recommend brevity in tweets."
"@neontaster Yes, these will get the same Timeline screen space as other tweets, but you will be able to click for more"
I hope that the people of Brazil are able to resolve matters peacefully

@TrungTPhan 🔥🤣
@micsolana Step up your game 🤣🤣
Easy swipe right/left to move between recommended vs followed tweets rolls out later this week.  First part of a much larger UI overhaul.  Bookmark button (de facto silent like) on Tweet details rolls out a week later.  Long form tweets early Feb.
@WholeMarsBlog We have a real shot at late February.  March launch attempt appears highly likely.
@DavidSacks It will go lower
@PeterDiamandis Risky Business (great movie)
@BillyM2k 🤣
@TheBabylonBee 🤣
@SamTwits @CommunityNotes
@TheRabbitHole84 👀
@NASASpaceflight It’s amazing to see them work in unison – so much has to go right for that to happen!
"@engineers_feed Lol no, Newton’s Third Law"
Plaid is sickkk
@Jason The mind virus is strong in the Bay Area
@mayemusk @CBSNews @Twitter The fake emerald mine thing is so annoying (sigh). Like where exactly is this thing anyway!?
@WholeMarsBlog Looks like V11.3 will be ready for wide release in about 2 weeks. Many major improvements.
@TrungTPhan !
@MuskUniversity Happy days tbh
@paulg True
Thread on how safe Tesla cars are
@paulg People on Twitter should like more tweets in general!
@BillyM2k @KevinChunilal Nice
@WholeMarsBlog @ValerianIlies People still don’t get it
@_TheRealTony3_ @MercedesBenz @Tesla @SawyerMerritt Good for them
"@RichardGarriott Tanks are a deathtrap now. With neither side having air superiority, you’re left with infantry &amp; artillery – essentially WW1."
@BillyM2k 🤣
@TheRabbitHole84 An actual Jurassic Park would be awesome
(JCO was joking btw)
8 years later &amp; still no laws … 😢  https://t.co/9fjb24XvFG
@TheBabylonBee 🤣
@pmarca Twitter has at least 10 million Wokeys
@hodgetwins Looking into it
@laralogan This demands an explanation
"@HowThingsWork_ The Drone Wars are already a big deal, but we ain’t seen nothing yet …"
"If I dig my grave deep enough, maybe it comes out other side of Earth 🤔"
@RenataKonkoly Great advice! 🤣🤣
Some habits are hard to break lol.  Maybe I should just get bulletproof shoes …
@lrocket Hi Tom!
@Hitch_Slapping @DrJBhattacharya True
Ouch my feet!!
@cb_doge @MrAndyNgo @josephmenn @ExplainThisBob Will do. He is a good bot.
@MrAndyNgo @josephmenn Joseph Menn is a contemptible liar. Twitter policy has always been to suspend accounts that clearly &amp; repeatedly incite violence.
@jonastyle_ Journalists should do shots every time there is a negative article about me …
Elon Musk should
"Subtle, but I am beginning to suspect opinions differ on this matter …  If not McCarthy, then seriously who?"
@ChrisJBakke 🤣
Sped up trip there &amp; back again
@tomselliott 🤣🤣
"@heliobeltrao @Rconstantino @rothbard_brasil If it is ordered by the court, do we have any choice?"
Kevin McCarthy should be Speaker
@pmarca 🤦‍♂️
@MuskUniversity Necessary to make life multiplanetary
@pmarca It’s a new world. Goodbye homework!
@CathieDWood Wow
@Basti Public likes &amp; non-public likes (aka bookmarks) should both be included in like count.   Bookmark button should be on main tweet view.
@GadSaad True.
